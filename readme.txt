# Container_Analysis
Warehouses and Ports use shipping containers as a means of storage as they are effi- cient,scalable and durable but they require proper identification, logging and increased security to avoid being stolen. A great fraction of these thefts are due to corruption, col- lusion, and mismanagement within the warehouse. Our solution to the problem is this: A comprehensive IoT-based security system for warehouse containers on site, employing advanced vision technology to autonomously identify the containers, with cloud integra- tion for real-time monitoring and management. It aims to automate container tracking us- ing a power and cost efficient dead reckoning algorithm, enhance security, and streamline operations,significantly improving inventory accuracy and operational efficiency, and reli- ability in varying warehouse scales.

A cutting-edge solution to within warehouse tracking that is both low power, cost effi- cient, and easy to set up. The logging system, using advanced vision technology, is far easier to set up than RFID, and dead reckoning using inertial data allows the containers to be tracked within warehouses, where GPS signals are limited. Other solutions require placing sensors in multiple areas within the warehouse, which is also difficult to set up. Our solution is both innovative and efficient as a single node is required to track a con- tainer, which is attached on entry, and can be reused when the container exists the facility. We have also developed a user friendly website that our customers can use for ordering the nodes, and deploying them in their warehouse. Furthermore, we are using cutting edge LoRaWAN IoT technology which is known for its power efficiency. Our device, provided to us by RiseTech, lasts 2.5 years on battery. This is a novel solution that can change the landscape of within warehouse tracking, and set a new standard not just in Pakistan, but internationally as well.
We improved upon the Dead Reckoning algorithm by using filters to remove errors and noise from sensor data. This gives a power-efficient alternative to GPS when it comes to tracking objects. The algorithm ran on an STM32 micro-controller making it cost- effective and easy to setup.
A State-Of-The-Art Object Detection model was trained to detect containers and then an open-source OCR was utilized to extract the container ID from it by filtering the recog- nized texts using a regular expression pattern corresponding to container ID format.
